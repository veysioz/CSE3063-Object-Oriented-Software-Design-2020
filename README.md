<b>Java Project (Data Labelling System)</b>

<p>In this project, we made an Object-Oriented program where we can label words. In this program, the user can login to the system with username and password and start labeling words. The user can continue from where he left off after logging out and logging in. Apart from real users, there are also bot users who can label words randomly.</p>

<b>Python Project (Zoom Poll Analyzer)</b>

<p>In this project, we made an Object-Oriented program that can analyze zoom polls. This program matches students on the zoom list with students on the class list (due to different names) and analyzes their answers on polls. It looks at all the polls and calculates the averages of the students. At the same time, it records the attendance according to whether the students join the polls or not.</p>
